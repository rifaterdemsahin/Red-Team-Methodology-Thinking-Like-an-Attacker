# 🎯 1_Real: Objectives & Key Results

- **Premise:** Every project must begin with a clear and measurable goal. This folder establishes the **"why"** behind the work.
- **Content:** High-level objectives and key results (OKRs).
- **Conclusion:** Aligns all work with a tangible purpose.

## 📌 Project Objective
To demonstrate how **ML Red Teaming** proactively identifies security vulnerabilities in machine learning systems by simulating realistic adversaries.

### Core Concept: Red Teaming vs Penetration Testing

#### Penetration Testing
-   **Scope**: Narrow and specific
-   **Goal**: Find known vulnerability types
-   **Mindset**: Technical vulnerability scanning
-   **Example**: "Test if API allows SQL injection"

#### Red Teaming
-   **Scope**: Broad and realistic
-   **Goal**: Simulate what adversaries would discover
-   **Mindset**: Strategic attack chains and realistic scenarios
-   **Example**: "How would a competitor steal our model?"

### The Red Team Mindset
-   **Think like attackers**: What motivates them? What capabilities do they have?
-   **Chain attacks**: Combine multiple techniques for realistic scenarios
-   **Strategic goals**: Not just "can we break it?" but "what would attackers do with this?"
-   **Discover before adversaries**: Find vulnerabilities proactively, not reactively

### Goals
-   **Goal 1**: Execute a complete red team engagement on a content moderation system
-   **Goal 2**: Discover evasion techniques that bypass the model
-   **Goal 3**: Document vulnerabilities and prioritize fixes
-   **Key Result**: Identify at least 3 high-severity attack vectors with >70% success rate

## 📊 Red Teaming Value Proposition

### Without Red Teaming
-   Vulnerabilities discovered by adversaries first
-   Reactive security posture
-   Costly incidents and reputational damage
-   Unknown attack surface

### With Red Teaming
-   Proactive vulnerability discovery
-   Strategic security improvements
-   Reduced incident likelihood
-   Comprehensive threat understanding
