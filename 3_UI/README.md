# 🧠 3_UI: Knowledge & Skill Acquisition

- **Premise:** Development is a journey of learning.
- **Content:** A personal knowledge base for concepts, theories, and skills.
- **Conclusion:** Fosters continuous improvement.

## 🎨 The User Interface
In this project, the **UI is the Notebook itself**, serving as the red team engagement report.

### Phase 1: Planning Section
-   **Markdown Cells**: Define target system and threat model.
-   **Code Cells**: Document adversary profiles and attack goals.
-   **Visualizations**: Threat matrix (likelihood × impact).

### Phase 2: Reconnaissance Section
-   **Markdown Cells**: System architecture and attack surface.
-   **Code Cells**: Probe the model for weaknesses.
-   **Visualizations**: Decision boundary plots, confidence distributions.

### Phase 3: Exploitation Section
-   **Markdown Cells**: Attack strategies and techniques.
-   **Code Cells**: Execute evasion attacks with various obfuscations.
-   **Visualizations**: Attack success rates, before/after examples.

### Phase 4: Reporting Section
-   **Markdown Cells**: Executive summary and recommendations.
-   **Code Cells**: Generate vulnerability reports and metrics.
-   **Visualizations**: Severity rankings, attack chain diagrams.

### Interactive Elements
-   Live attack demonstrations
-   Side-by-side comparisons (original vs evaded input)
-   Success rate tracking across attack variants
-   Vulnerability severity heatmaps
